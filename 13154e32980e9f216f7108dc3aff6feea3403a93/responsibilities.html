            <h2 class="about">4a. Reflecting on Teaching</h2>
            <p class="about">Reflecting on teaching encompasses the teacher’s thinking that follows any instructional
                event, an analysis of the many decisions made in both the planning and the implementation of a lesson.
                By considering these elements in light of the impact they had on student learning, teachers can
                determine where to focus their efforts in making revisions and choose which aspects of the instruction
                they will continue in future lessons. Teachers may reflect on their practice through collegial
                conversations, journal writing, examining student work, conversations with students, or simply thinking
                about their teaching. Reflecting with accuracy and specificity, as well as being able to use in future
                teaching what has been learned, is an acquired skill; mentors, coaches, and supervisors can help
                teachers acquire and develop the skill of reflecting on teaching through supportive and deep
                questioning. Over time, this way of thinking both reflectively and self-critically and of analyzing
                instruction through the lens of student learning— whether excellent, adequate, or inadequate—becomes a
                habit of mind, leading to improvement in teaching and learning.</p>

                <p><strong>Document Description: </strong>Over the last few years I have had many opportunities to
                    reflect upon my teaching skills and how my lessons went. At first, I viewed this as just busy work,
                    but over the last year, I’ve learned that actually writing out a reflection is a powerful tool. I’ve
                    learned to think more deeply about different aspects of my lessons and make meaningful goals that I
                    could work on over the next couple of weeks. These have helped me become a better teacher because
                    These goals helped me know how I was teaching every day, and by making effective adjustments to help
                    my students learn, I have become a better teacher.</p>

                <p><strong>Document Description: </strong>Every week during my preschool lab experience, I kept a
                    journal in which I reflected on my lead or support teaching experiences throughout the week. This
                    journal entry is a reflection from a week where I was the lead teacher. I analyzed specific examples
                    of how children responded to activities, how I made an effort to include students who weren’t
                    engaged, and what I could do to make my activities more engaging and applicable to the children.</p>

            <h2 class="about">4b. Maintaining Accurate Records</h2>
            <p class="about">An essential responsibility of professional educators is keeping accurate records of both
                instructional and noninstructional events. These include student completion of assignments, student
                progress in learning, and noninstructional activities that are part of the day-to-day functions in a
                school setting, such as the return of signed permission slips for a field trip and money for school
                pictures. Proficiency in this component is vital because these records inform interactions with students
                and parents and allow teachers to monitor learning and adjust instruction accordingly. The methods of
                keeping records vary as much as the type of information being recorded. For example, teachers may keep
                records of formal assessments electronically, using spreadsheets and databases, which allow for item
                analysis and individualized instruction. A less formal means of keeping track of student progress may
                include anecdotal notes that are kept in student folders.</p>

                <p><strong>Document Description: </strong>Every day after teaching in my preschool lab, I wrote down
                    some specific examples of how children demonstrated use of developmental abilities such as language
                    or motor skills. Writing these down helped me and the other teachers in my lab keep track of where
                    each child was developmentally and aided us in making plans to help them learn. I learned that it is
                    important to frequently write detailed examples because it helps in understanding a child’s current
                    level of learning and development.</p>

                    parents and I had created at the beginning of the semester. At the end of each week, I wrote a short
                    report about what I had observed using these daily notes. I had to be consistent in my note taking,
                    and they had to be accurate so I could complete the reports for the families each week.</p>

            <h2 class="about">4c. Communicating with Families</h2>
            <p class="about">Although the ability of families to participate in their child’s learning varies widely
                because of other family or job obligations, it is the responsibility of teachers to provide
                opportunities for them to understand both the instructional program and their child’s progress. Teachers
                establish relationships with families by communicating to them about the instructional program,
                conferring with them about individual students, and inviting them to be part of the educational process
                itself. The level of family participation and involvement tends to be greater at the elementary level,
                when young children are just beginning school. However, the importance of regular communication with
                families of adolescents cannot be overstated. A teacher’s effort to communicate with families conveys
                the teacher’s essential caring, valued by families of students of all ages.</p>

                    open and get to know the families of the children. At the beginning of the semester, my partner and
                    I had a hard time getting to know the mother of a child. We felt that we wouldn’t be able to really
                    help her child because we hadn’t been able to develop a good relationship and effectively
                    communicate with her. After about five weeks of visiting, however, we finally made a connection and
                    were able to confidently move forward with our interventions and know that she was on our side.</p>

                    information provided would be useful for the parents. This document shows that I am capable of
                    communicating information to parents in a professional manner.</p>

            <h2 class="about">4d. Participating in a Professional Community</h2>
            <p class="about">Schools are, first of all, environments to promote the learning of students. But in
                promoting student learning, teachers must work with their colleagues to share strategies, plan joint
                efforts, and plan for the success of individual students. Schools are, in other words, professional
                organizations for teachers, with their full potential realized only when teachers regard themselves as
                members of a professional community. This community is characterized by mutual support and respect, as
                well as by recognition of the responsibility of all teachers to be constantly seeking ways to improve
                their practice and to contribute to the life of the school. Inevitably, teachers’ duties extend beyond
                the doors of their classrooms and include activities related to the entire school or larger district, or
                both. These activities include such things as school and district curriculum committees or engagement
                with the parent-teacher organization. With experience, teachers assume leadership roles in these
                activities.</p>

                <p><strong>Document Description: </strong>During my senior practicum class, I read a book about
                    effective ways to differentiate in classrooms. I took notes on interesting ideas I found useful in
                    each chapter. I co-created a PowerPoint about a specific chapter and helped lead a discussion with
                    my fellow student teachers about how to create environments that support differentiated instruction.
                    I then applied some of my learning in my practicum classroom. Reading this book helped me grow

                    expressing appreciation for their teaching style. Since then, I’ve striven to develop the
                    characteristics I saw them doing during toddler lab. I learned that it is important to recognize
                    what our co-workers are doing well and then try to develop those characteristics and habits. In
                    addition, I learned that it is important to recognize what fellow professionals are doing well and
                    thank them. By doing this, teachers develop good relationships with each other and create a network
                    upon which they can rely.</p>

            <h2 class="about">4e. Growing and Developing Professionally</h2>
            <p class="about">As in other professions, the complexity of teaching requires continued growth and
                development in order for teachers to remain current. Continuing to stay informed and increasing their
                skills allows teachers to become ever more effective and to exercise leadership among their colleagues.
                The academic disciplines themselves evolve, and educators constantly refine their understanding of how
                to engage students in learning; thus, growth in content, pedagogy, and information technology are
                essential to good teaching. Networking with colleagues through such activities as joint planning, study
                groups, and lesson study provides opportunities for teachers to learn from one another. These activities
                allow for job-iframeded professional development. In addition, professional educators increase their
                effectiveness in the classroom by belonging to professional organizations, reading professional
                journals, attending educational conferences, and taking university classes. As they gain experience and
                expertise, educators find ways to contribute to their colleagues and to the profession.</p>

                    paths, options for graduate level degrees for teachers, and what teachers need to know before their
                    first year of teaching. I also attended workshops about maintaining attention in the classroom and

                    assembling portfolios. This certificate is one I received for attending the portfolio training.
                    Attending these meetings every semester helped me develop professionally because I learned what to

            <h2 class="about">4f. Showing Professionalism</h2>
            <p class="about">Expert teachers demonstrate professionalism in service both to students and to the
                profession. Teaching at the highest levels of performance in this component is student focused, putting
                students first regardless of how this stance might challenge long-held assumptions, past practice, or
                simply the easier or more convenient procedure. Accomplished teachers have a strong moral compass and
                are guided by what is in the best interest of each student. They display professionalism in a number of
                ways. For example, they conduct interactions with colleagues in a manner notable for honesty and
                integrity. Furthermore, they know their students’ needs and can readily access resources with which to
                step in and provide help that may extend beyond the classroom. Seeking greater flexibility in the ways
                school rules and policies are applied, expert teachers advocate for their students in ways that might
                challenge traditional views and the educational establishment. They also display professionalism in the
                ways they approach problem solving and decision making, with student needs constantly in mind. Finally,
                accomplished teachers consistently adhere to school and district policies and procedures but are willing
                to work to improve those that may be outdated or ineffective.</p>

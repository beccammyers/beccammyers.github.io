               <p class="about">In order to guide student learning, teachers must have command of the subjects they teach. They must know which concepts and skills are central to a discipline and which are peripheral; they must know how the discipline has evolved into the 21st century, incorporating issues such as global awareness and cultural diversity. Accomplished teachers understand the internal relationships within the disciplines they teach, knowing which concepts and skills are prerequisite to the understanding of others. They are also aware of typical student misconceptions in the discipline and work to dispel them. Though, knowledge of the content is not sufficient; in advancing student understanding, teachers must be familiar with the particularly pedagogical approaches best suited to each discipline.</p></div>

               <p><strong>Document Description: </strong>Throughout my education, I have had the opportunity to learn about Developmentally Appropriate Practices (DAP) and apply them in different classroom settings.  In my child 230 class, I learned about them in great detail and wrote a paper about DAP principles.  This paper includes my understanding of DAP and what it means to apply it to a classroom.  </p>

               <p><strong>Document Description: </strong>During my Toddler Lab Practicum experience, I wrote lesson plans tailored to every child’s needs and developmental abilities.  I looked at what each child could do developmentally and planned activities to help them further develop their current skills and work on those they were struggling with.  This demonstrates my ability to plan activities that will help children’s current developmental skills grow and build on each other.</p>

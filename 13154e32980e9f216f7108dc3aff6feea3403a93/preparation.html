            <h2 class="about">1a. Demonstrating Knowledge of Content and Pedagogy</h2>
            <p class="about">In order to guide student learning, teachers must have command of the subjects they teach.
                They must know which concepts and skills are central to a discipline and which are peripheral; they must
                know how the discipline has evolved into the 21st century, incorporating issues such as global awareness
                and cultural diversity. Accomplished teachers understand the internal relationships within the
                disciplines they teach, knowing which concepts and skills are prerequisite to the understanding of
                others. They are also aware of typical student misconceptions in the discipline and work to dispel them.
                Though, knowledge of the content is not sufficient; in advancing student understanding, teachers must be
                familiar with the particularly pedagogical approaches best suited to each discipline.</p>

            <h2 class="about">1b. Demonstrating Knowledge of Students</h2>
            <p class="about">Teachers don’t teach content in the abstract; they teach it to students. In order to ensure
                student learning, teachers must know not only their content and its related pedagogy but also the
                students to whom they wish to teach that content. While there are patterns in cognitive, social, and
                emotional developmental stages typical of different age groups, students learn in their individual ways
                and may have gaps or misconceptions the teacher needs to uncover in order to plan appropriate learning
                activities. In addition, students have lives beyond school—lives that include athletic and musical
                pursuits, activities in their neighborhoods, and family and cultural traditions. Students whose first
                language is not English, as well as students with other special needs, must be considered when a teacher
                is planning lessons and identifying resources to ensure that all students will be able to learn.</p>

                    child in at least one activity center. This part of a lesson plan demonstrates my ability to create

            <h2 class="about">1c. Setting Instructional Outcomes</h2>
            <p class="about">Teaching is a purposeful activity; even the most imaginative activities are directed toward
                certain desired learning. Therefore, establishing instructional outcomes entails identifying exactly
                what students will be expected to learn; the outcomes describe not what students will do, but what they
                will learn. The instructional outcomes should reflect important learning and must lend themselves to
                various forms of assessment through which all students will be able to demonstrate their understanding
                of the content. Learning outcomes may be of a number of different types: factual and procedural
                knowledge, conceptual understanding, thinking and reasoning skills, and collaborative and communication
                strategies. In addition, some learning outcomes refer to dispositions; it’s important not only that
                students learn to read but also, educators hope, that they will like to read. In addition, experienced
                teachers are able to link their learning outcomes with outcomes both within their discipline and in
                other disciplines.</p>

            <h2 class="about">1d. Demonstrating Knowledge of Resources</h2>
            <p class="about">Student learning is enhanced by a teacher’s skillful use of resources. Some of these are
                provided by the school as “official” materials; others are secured by teachers through their own
                initiative. Resources fall into several different categories: those used in the classroom by students,
                those available beyond the classroom walls to enhance student learning, resources for teachers to
                further their own professional knowledge and skill, and resources that can provide noninstructional
                assistance to students. Teachers recognize the importance of discretion in the selection of resources,
                selecting those that align directly with the learning outcomes and will be of most use to the students.
                Accomplished teachers also ensure that the selection of materials and resources is appropriately
                challenging for every student. Texts, for example, are available at various reading levels to make sure
                all students can gain full access to the content and successfully demonstrate understanding of the
                learning outcomes. Furthermore, expert teachers look beyond the school for resources to bring their
                subjects to life and to assist students who need help in both their academic and nonacademic lives.</p>

            <h2 class="about">1e. Designing Coherent Instruction</h2>
            <p class="about">Designing coherent instruction is the heart of planning, reflecting the teacher’s knowledge
                of content and of the students in the class, the intended outcomes of instruction, and the available
                resources. Such planning requires educators have a clear understanding of the state, district, and
                school expectations for student learning and the skill to translate these into a coherent plan. It also
                requires teachers understand the characteristics of the students they teach and the active nature of
                student learning. Educators must determine how best to sequence instruction in a way that will advance
                student learning through the required content. Furthermore, such planning requires the thoughtful
                construction of lessons that contain cognitively engaging learning activities, the incorporation of
                appropriate resources and materials, and the intentional grouping of students. Proficient practice in
                this component recognizes that a well-designed instruction plan addresses the learning needs of various
                groups of students; one size does not fit all. At the distinguished level, the teacher plans instruction
                that takes into account the specific learning needs of each student and solicits ideas from students on
                how best to structure the learning.</p>

            <h2 class="about">1f. Designing Student Assessments</h2>
            <p class="about">Good teaching requires both assessment of learning and assessment for learning. Assessments
                of learning ensure teachers know students have learned the intended outcomes. These assessments must be
                designed in such a manner that they provide evidence of the full range of learning outcomes; that is,
                the methods needed to assess reasoning skills are different from those for factual knowledge.
                Furthermore, such assessments may need to be adapted to the particular needs of individual students. An
                ESL student, for example, may need an alternative method of assessment to allow demonstration of
                understanding. Assessment for learning enables a teacher to incorporate assessments directly into the
                instructional process and to modify or adapt instruction as needed to ensure student understanding. Such
                assessments, although used during instruction, must be designed as part of the planning process. These
                formative assessment strategies are ongoing and may be used by both teachers and students to monitor
                progress toward understanding the learning outcomes.</p>

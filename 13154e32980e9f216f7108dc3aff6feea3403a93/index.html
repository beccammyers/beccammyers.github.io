        <h2 class="about">About Me</h2>
        <p class="about">My name is Rebecca Myers, and I am currently a student at Brigham Young University-Idaho
            studying Early Childhood/Special Education. I have had a passion for working with young children since I
            started babysitting as a young teenager and as I taught swimming lessons. The joy that comes from working
            with young children followed me through to my first time teaching in a first-grade elementary class. As I’ve
            taken classes and had opportunities to work with children, my educational philosophy has grown and
            developed. I have discovered that students learn best when the activities and lessons are tailored to the
            individual and are developmentally appropriate for their age. I’m excited to design a learning environment
            where children participate in hands-on activities and are eager to participate and learn.</p>

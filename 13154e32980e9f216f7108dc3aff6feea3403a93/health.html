                <p><strong>Document Description: </strong>At the beginning of preschool lab, the other teachers and I
                    gathered different health and safety records, such as proof of immunizations, insurance information,
                    and consent forms for each of the children in the lab. These documents are required for each child
                    to participate in lab and helped us ensure that we had the proper legal documentation for their
                    participation and to help keep everyone safe. This document is a template of the one we used to
                    record what documents we had for each child and demonstrates my understanding of how important it is
                    to have a list of health and safety information.</p>

                <p><strong>Document Description: </strong>While in my family and community relationships class, I
                    learned how to properly store confidential items, such as health and safety information and
                    educational records, behind at least two locks. While in toddler and preschool lab, I practiced this
                    as we kept a bin of health records and other child information behind two locked doors in our
                    classroom. Each day in lab, I had to make sure the records were never left alone in the open, and
                    that when I left for the day, they were locked in the closet with the classroom door locked. This
                    shows that I understand the laws that are in effect to protect people’s privacy. </p>

                <p><strong>Document Description: </strong>While in toddler and preschool lab, I read the BYU-Idaho Child
                    Labs Student Handbook. I implemented the policies and procedures outlined in the handbook while in
                    both labs. Some of these procedures included diapering and other safety procedures, expectations for
                    student professionalism, and confidentiality policies. I learned that it is important to have
                    procedures and policies in place not only to protect the children I worked with, but myself and the
                    other teachers in my lab. </p>

                    labs, I received special training on first aid and CPR. I learned how to respond to a variety of
                    emergency situations, including simple cuts and bruises along with more severe situations, such as
                    shock or lacerations. Luckily, I didn’t have to use this training for anything more than bruises and
                    simple scrapes, but I have the training should I ever need to use it. </p>

                <p><strong>Document Description: </strong>During my Intervention with Infants class, I wrote a resource
                    plan with a partner. The parents I worked with expressed their concerns, and then my partner and I
                    created a list of resources available to help them address the concerns. During an intervention
                    session, we explained the resources we found. I learned that it can sometimes be a daunting task to
                    sift through all the information available online, especially for parents who don’t know where to
                    start looking for ideas to help their child. That’s why it’s important for professionals to help
                    parents by giving them a few resources that they can use to help find more.</p>

                <p><strong>Document Description: </strong>One of the children in my toddler lab was very allergic to
                    peanuts. His mother trained us on how to use an Epi-Pen just in case he was to have a reaction
                    during lab. The other teachers and I had to make sure that we didn’t eat anything with peanuts the
                    days we had lab, and we also made sure that the other parents were aware and could make sure their
                    children didn’t come into lab with peanut butter on their clothes or bodies. I learned that it is
                    very important to make sure everyone involved is aware of the situation and trained to help in case
                    of an emergency.</p>

                <p><strong>Document Description: </strong>While in preschool lab, I prepared snacks for the children

                    appropriately portion servings. This is a picture of the snack schedule. If the items listed for
                    snack that day weren’t available, I learned how to make appropriate substitutions. This shows that I
                    am capable of preparing and serving children nutritional food that is good for their development.

                <p><strong>Document Description: </strong>Over the last three years, I volunteered at the Helping Hands
                    and Life Skills classes held on campus for adults with disabilities. Every week we did crafts and
                    other games or learned basic skills, such as writing letters. I got to know some of the people
                    really well and had a wonderful experience working with adults who have disabilities such as Down
                    syndrome and cerebral palsy. This is a reflection I wrote for my Family and Community Relationships
                    class about my experiences volunteering. This shows that I have experience working with a variety of
                    ages, not just children.</p>

                    the lower part of her leg missing. The occupational therapist trained all of the teachers in my lab
                    on how to help her successfully crawl around the room. In addition, we planned activities and room
                    design so that she could access all the activities with minimal assistance. This experience taught
                    me how to accommodate for physical disabilities and shows that I am willing to make changes to fit
                    the needs of my specific students.</p>

                    procedures for fire drills with the children every month so that everyone was familiar with the plan
                    and knew what to do in case there was a real emergency. This shows that I am prepared to learn

                    short course on abuse recognition and prevention called Stewards of Children. I learned signs of
                    emotional and physical abuse and how to gather more information without leading children to give
                    specific answers. I also learned how to properly report it to my superiors and Child Welfare. This
                    is the booklet we used during the training, showing that I am capable of keeping the children I work
                    with safe by recognizing possible signs of abuse. </p>

Several times in lab, this child vomited, and we put a black cloth covering it to keep the children away while we got our cleaning supplies.

            <h2 class="about">2a. Creating an Environment of Respect and Rapport</h2>
            <p class="about"> An essential skill of teaching is that of managing relationships with students and
                ensuring that relationships among students are positive and supportive. Teachers create an environment
                of respect and rapport in their classrooms by the ways they interact with students and by the
                interactions they encourage and cultivate among students. An important aspect of respect and rapport
                relates to how the teacher responds to students and how students are permitted to treat one another.
                Patterns of interactions are critical to the overall tone of the class. In a respectful environment, all
                students feel valued, safe, and comfortable taking intellectual risks. They do not fear put-downs or
                ridicule from either the teacher or other students. “Respect” shown to the teacher by students should be
                distinguished from students complying with standards of conduct and behavior.</p>

                <p><strong>Document Description: </strong>While teaching in preschool lab, I learned that validating how
                    children feel is essential to establishing a good relationship with them. Throughout my lab
                    experience, I made sure to validate how children felt when they were upset about having to clean up
                    or take turns. I explained that I knew they were sad and didn’t want to put the toys away or take
                    turns sharing a toy with another child. As the semester progressed, I could see that the children
                    were more willing to take turns or help clean-up when I asked because I had viewed their feelings as
                    important.</p>

                    effective listener. This document shows that I understand the different types of listeners and am
                    capable of developing good relationships with students and coworkers because I am able to listen
                    effectively.</p>

            <h2 class="about">2b. Establishing a Culture for Learning</h2>
            <p class="about">A “culture for learning” refers to the atmosphere in the classroom that reflects the
                educational importance of the work undertaken by both students and teacher. It describes the norms that
                govern the interactions among individuals about the activities and assignments, the value of hard work
                and perseverance, and the general tone of the class. The classroom is characterized by high cognitive
                energy, by a sense that what is happening there is important, and by a shared belief that it is
                essential, and rewarding, to get it right. There are high expectations for all students; the classroom
                is a place where the teacher and students value learning and hard work. Teachers who are successful in
                creating a culture for learning know students are, by their nature, intellectually curious, and that one
                of the many challenges of teaching is to direct the students’ natural energy toward the content of the
                curriculum. Part of a culture of hard work involves precision in thought and language; teachers whose
                classrooms display such a culture insist that students use language to express their thoughts clearly.
                An emphasis on precision reflects the importance placed, by both teacher and students, on the quality of
                thinking; this emphasis conveys that the classroom is a business-like place where important work is
                being undertaken. The classroom atmosphere may be vibrant, even joyful, but it is not frivolous.</p>

                <p><strong>Document Description: </strong>While planning lessons and activities during my preschool lab
                    experience, I focused on making sure that each activity I planned was fun, but that it also had a
                    specific purpose to help children learn. For each activity, I created a child objective in which I
                    included an Idaho Early Learning Guideline; these guidelines are developmental goals that young
                    children should be learning. Each activity focused on helping children develop at least one of these
                    goals. I learned through teaching these activities that, when children are engaging, the activities
                    are a natural learning opportunity.</p>

            <h2 class="about">2c. Managing Classroom Procedures</h2>
            <p class="about">A smoothly functioning classroom is a prerequisite to good instruction and high levels of
                student engagement. Teachers establish and monitor routines and procedures for the smooth operation of
                the classroom and the efficient use of time. Hallmarks of a well-managed classroom are that
                instructional groups are used effectively, noninstructional tasks are completed efficiently, and
                transitions between activities and management of materials and supplies are skillfully done in order to
                maintain momentum and maximize instructional time. The establishment of efficient routines, and teaching
                students to employ them, may be inferred from the sense that the class “runs itself.”</p>

                <p><strong>Document Description: </strong>Managing a classroom is something that I’ve struggled with
                    over the last couple of years. It’s not easy for me to decide on procedures and then use them
                    consistently. During my Senior practicum class, I created several professional growth goals that I
                    will be working on during my student teaching experience. This document is my first goal and a plan
                    to help me reach it. It shows that I am capable of realizing my weaknesses and creating goals and
                    plans to help me improve in my skills.</p>

            <div class="grid-item">
                <p><strong>Document Description: </strong>While I struggled with managing classroom procedures at the
                    beginning of my toddler experience, I learned how to set expectations for behaviors. For example,
                    during the cleaning routine I learned to be persistent in making sure the children in my lab helped
                    clean up. I used verbal, physical, auditory, and visual prompts to remind my students what time it
                    was. By the end of the semester, all of the children in our lab would help clean up when they saw me
                    put the cleaning bins out and play the clean-up song, and I rarely had to help children put toys in
                    the bins because they did it themselves. These documents are lead teaching rubrics from the middle
                    and end of the semester and show growth in my ability to effectively manage classroom procedures.

            <h2 class="about">2d. Managing Student Behavior</h2>
            <p class="about">In order for students to be able to engage deeply with content, the classroom environment
                must be orderly; the atmosphere must feel business-like and productive, without being authoritarian. In
                a productive classroom, standards of conduct are clear to students; they know what they are permitted to
                do and what they can expect of their classmates. Even when their behavior is being corrected, students
                feel respected; their dignity is not undermined. Skilled teachers regard positive student behavior not
                as an end in itself, but as a prerequisite to high levels of engagement in content.</p>

                <p><strong>Document Description: </strong>During my preschool lab experience, I worked with an autistic
                    child who, at the beginning of lab, put classroom materials in inappropriate areas. As a lab, we
                    created a plan to help him learn where he could put materials. I consistently redirected him by
                    explaining and physically helping him put the items in their respective areas, multiple times if
                    needed. After just two weeks of redirecting, we saw significant improvement as he made fewer
                    attempts to put items in inappropriate places.</p>

            <div class="grid-item">
                <p><strong>Document Description: </strong>This presentation explains how to use positive expectations to
                    help students learn and behave appropriately. I created it in my ED 243 class after reading some
                    chapters from a book on how to be an effective teacher. From reading this book I learned that by
                    having positive expectations, teachers don’t need to correct behaviors as much because their
                    students will do what is expected of them. “No one has yet fully realized the wealth of sympathy,
                    kindness, and generosity hidden in the soul of a child. The effort of every true educator should be
                    to unlock that treasure (Emma Goldman).” This is one of my favorite quotes from the book because it
                    is a great reminder that inside every child is good, and that they will show that goodness if we
                    treat them with the respect they deserve. This presentation shows that I understand the importance
                    of having a positive classroom environment where students feel like they are smart and can learn.

            <p class="about">The use of the physical environment to promote student learning is a hallmark of an
                experienced teacher. Its use varies, of course, with the age of the students: in a primary classroom,
                centers and reading corners may structure class activities; while with older students, the position of
                chairs and desks can facilitate, or inhibit, rich discussion. Naturally, classrooms must be safe (no
                dangling wires or dangerous traffic patterns), and all students must be able to see and hear what’s
                going on so that they can participate actively. Both the teacher and students must make effective use of
                electronics and other technology.</p>
